### Technical Overview of the Maze Navigation Game

#### Architecture
The game is built using JavaScript and the Three.js library, which allows for creating 3D graphics in a web browser. The main components of the game include:

1. **Scene Setup**: This is where the game environment is created. It includes the scene, camera, and renderer. The scene contains all the objects, the camera defines the view, and the renderer displays the graphics on the screen.

2. **Maze Generation**: The maze is created using a recursive backtracking algorithm. This algorithm generates a random maze structure, determining where walls should be placed and where open paths exist.

3. **Player Control**: The player is represented by a 3D sphere that can be moved using the keyboard. The movement is controlled by capturing keyboard events and updating the player's position accordingly.

4. **Collision Detection**: To ensure the player can't move through walls, the game uses bounding boxes for both the player and the walls. Collision detection checks if the playerâ€™s new position would intersect with any wall.

5. **Game Over Logic**: When the player reaches the exit point (the open wall opposite the entry point), a "Game Over" screen appears, giving the player the option to restart the game.

#### Algorithms
1. **Recursive Backtracking for Maze Generation**: This algorithm starts from a random cell in the maze and recursively visits neighboring cells that haven't been visited yet, carving paths by removing walls.

2. **Collision Detection**: The game uses Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB) to check for collisions between the player and the walls. This is done by creating a bounding box for the player and checking if it intersects with any wall bounding boxes.

#### Challenges
1. **Maze Complexity**: Creating a challenging and fun maze requires careful consideration of the wall placement and the player's path options.

2. **Collision Handling**: Ensuring smooth movement without getting stuck on walls was challenging. The collision detection logic needed to be precise to avoid frustrating gameplay.

3. **User Interface**: Designing an appealing and functional user interface for the game over screen was important to enhance user experience.

#### Methodologies
1. **Modular Code Structure**: The code is organized into functions, each handling specific tasks (like rendering the maze, moving the player, etc.). This makes it easier to read, understand, and maintain.

2. **Commenting and Documentation**: The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose of each function and key lines of code. This helps anyone reading the code to quickly grasp what each part does.


### Conclusion
This maze navigation game demonstrates fundamental concepts of game development, including scene management, event handling, and collision detection. The approach taken in designing the maze, along with clear code organization and documentation, contributes to a fun and engaging experience for players. By continuously improving the interface and code structure, the game not only becomes more enjoyable but also serves as a learning tool for future projects.
